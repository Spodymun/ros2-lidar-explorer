# ROS2 Lidar Mapping & Navigation  

## How This Works üöÄ  

This project is based on **@Articulated Robotics' YouTube tutorials** ([Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLunhqkrRNRhYAffV8JDiFOatQXuU-NnxT)).  
I followed the series up to **"Using ros2_control to drive our robot (off the edge of the bench...)"** but have since made **many modifications**.  

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT

Please review the **differences yourself**, as well as the **dependencies** used in the original videos.  
I (**hopefully**) added the full list down below.

After cloning the other repositories, make sure to visit them yourself and work through their individual setup guides.

## Setup Guide üèó  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install ROS 2 (Verified: **03.03.2025**)  
Follow the official ROS 2 **Jazzy** installation guide:  
üîó [ROS 2 Jazzy Installation](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debs.html)  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a ROS2 Workspace (Verified: **14.03.2025**)  
Follow this guide to set up a workspace:  
üîó [Creating a ROS 2 Workspace](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Creating-A-Workspace/Creating-A-Workspace.html)  

#### Tips:  
- My workspace is named **`ws_lidar`** ‚Äì I recommend using the same name to avoid issues with my scripts.  
- Clone this repo into your workspace:  
  ```bash
  cd ~/ws_lidar/src
  git clone https://github.com/Spodymun/ros2-lidar-explorer
  ```
You'll need to set up a hotspot using a laptop, mobile phone, or another compatible device.
Once connected, you can find the IP address of your ESP.

#### üì¶ Essential Packages  
Please check **@Articulated Robotics' videos** videos for details. 

Run the following command to install the necessary ROS 2 packages:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y \
    ros-jazzy-rviz2 \
    ros-jazzy-slam-toolbox \
    ros-jazzy-teleop-twist-keyboard \
    ros-jazzy-nav2-bringup \
    ros-jazzy-rclpy \
    ros-jazzy-geometry-msgs \
    ros-jazzy-nav-msgs \
    ros-jazzy-tf2-ros \
    ros-jazzy-launch \
    ros-jazzy-launch-ros \
    ros-jazzy-ament-index-python \
    ros-jazzy-xacro \
    ros-jazzy-navigation2 \
    ros-jazzy-twist-mux \
    ros-jazzy-ros2-control \
    ros-jazzy-controller-manager


sudo apt install -y python3-requests python3-urllib3 python3-numpy
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up RPLidar with ROS 2

This guide explains how to clone and configure the `sllidar_ros2` package to work with your RPLidar device in a ROS 2 workspace.

#### üì¶ 1. Clone the `sllidar_ros2` Driver

Navigate to your workspace‚Äôs `src` directory and clone the official ROS 2 driver from Slamtec:

```bash
cd ~/ws_lidar/src
git clone https://github.com/Slamtec/sllidar_ros2
```

#### ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Configure the Driver

After cloning, navigate to the launch folder:

```bash
cd ~/ws_lidar/src/sllidar_ros2/launch
ls
```

Find the launch file that matches your RPLidar model.  
For example, if you're using an **A2M8**, it will likely be:

```bash
sllidar_a2m8_launch.py
```

Then make the following manual adjustments in that file:

##### ‚úÖ Update `frame_id`

- Replace all instances of `laser` with `laser_frame`
- This ensures TF compatibility across your system

##### ‚úÖ Set the `scan_mode`

- Change `scan_mode` to `"Standard"`  
- You can use another supported mode if your model requires it

#### ‚úçÔ∏è 3. Edit the Startup File

If you‚Äôre using a different model than the A2M8, make sure to update your startup script accordingly:

```bash
cd ~/ws_lidar/src/ros2-lidar-explorer
sudo nano startup.sh
```

Look for this line:

```bash
ros2 launch sllidar_ros2 sllidar_a2m8_launch.py
```

Change `sllidar_a2m8_launch.py` to the appropriate launch file for your Lidar model.

#### üöÄ 4. Rebuild and Source the Workspace

Once your changes are made:

```bash
cd ~/ws_lidar
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
```

Now your RPLidar should be ready to run with the correct configuration!

### üß† Autonomic Driving Integration for ROS 2 (Jazzy)

First, clone the `m-explore-ros2` exploration package into your workspace:

```bash
cd ~/ws_lidar/src
git clone https://github.com/robo-friends/m-explore-ros2.git
```
#### üõ† Fixing Compatibility with ROS 2 Jazzy

ROS 2 Jazzy introduced a breaking change in the `tf2_geometry_msgs` package.  
The header file `tf2_geometry_msgs.h` has been renamed to `tf2_geometry_msgs.hpp`.  
To update all source files accordingly, run:

```bash
find ~/ws_lidar/src -type f \( -name "*.cpp" -or -name "*.h" -or -name "*.hpp" \) | xargs sed -i 's|tf2_geometry_msgs/tf2_geometry_msgs.h|tf2_geometry_msgs/tf2_geometry_msgs.hpp|g'
```
#### üß© Updating Timer Callbacks

In **ROS 2 Jazzy**, the method `execute_callback()` from `rclcpp::TimerBase` has changed.  
It now requires an **explicit argument** of type `std::shared_ptr<void>`.  
To maintain compatibility, update all direct calls as shown below:

```cpp
map_merging_timer_->execute_callback();
topic_subscribing_timer_->execute_callback();
pose_estimation_timer_->execute_callback();
```
to:
```cpp
map_merging_timer_->execute_callback(nullptr);
topic_subscribing_timer_->execute_callback(nullptr);
pose_estimation_timer_->execute_callback(nullptr);
```
Once the changes are complete, build your ROS 2 workspace to apply them:

```bash
cd ~/ws_lidar
colcon build --symlink-install
```

# Matching Your System

## Matching Your Robot

### Measuring Wheel Radius & Wheel Distance
1. **`self.wheel_radius`**: Do not take real measurements, adjust it manually until the odometry matches the real-life movement.
2. **`self.wheel_offset_x`**: Do not take real measurements, adjust it manually until the odometry matches the real-life movement.

## Encoder Ticks & Motion Calibration

### 1. Measuring Encoder Ticks per Revolution
1. **Prepare the wheel**: Ensure it is free to rotate.
2. **Read the initial value**: Note the encoder reading.
3. **Rotate the wheel**: Complete one full revolution.
4. **Read the new value**: Calculate the difference:

   ```python
   TICKS_PER_REV = encoder_after - encoder_before
   print(f"Ticks per revolution: {TICKS_PER_REV}")
   ```
### 2. Calibrating Straight-Line Motion
1. **Perform the test**: Use `move.py` to move the robot forward.
2. **Measure the distance**:  
   - Observe the actual distance the robot moves.  
   - Compare it with the distance shown in the `/odom` data in RViz.  
3. **Adjust the scaling factor in `esp_http_control.py`**:
   
   ```python
   scaling_factor_straight = rviz_distance / actual_distance
   ```
   If the robot moves too short, increase the factor. If it moves too far, decrease it.

### 3. Calibrating Rotational Motion
1. **Perform the test**: Use `move.py` to rotate the robot in place.
2. **Measure the rotation angle**:  
   - Check how much the robot has turned in reality.  
   - Compare this with the rotation angle shown in the `/odom` data in RViz.  
3. **Adjust the scaling factor in `esp_http_control.py`**:  

   ```python
   scaling_factor_circle = rviz_angle / actual_angle
   ```
   If the rotation is too small, increase the factor. If it's too large, decrease it.
